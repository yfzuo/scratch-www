In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables.

It offers a number of new features:","faq.soundEditorRecording":"New recording system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorTrimming":"New audio trimming system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorEffects":"New sound effects (such as \"faster\", \"slower\", \"echo\", and \"robot\")","faq.tipsWindwScratch3Title":"What happened to the Scratch Tips Window?","faq.tipsWindowScratch3Body":"Instead of the Tips Window, Scratch 3.0 provides similar material through the Tutorials Library, which can be accessed through the Tutorials link in the top navigation bar in the programming editor. You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub. For updated information on development projects relating to the Scratch website, please visit our {developersLink}.","faq.scratch14":"Scratch 1.4","faq.okayToShareTitle":"How do I know what is or isn’t okay to share on the Scratch website?","faq.okayToShareBody":"Check out the Scratch {cgLink} - they’re brief and don’t include a lot of legal stuff. There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"سكراتش في المدرسة","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Currently, Scratch Desktop is available for Mac and Windows machines.","faq.communityTitle":"Can I turn off the online community for my students?","faq.communityBody":"The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share, collaborate, and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments.

We ask for additional information during the registration process in order to verify your role as an educator.","faq.dataTitle":"What data does Scratch collect about students?","faq.dataBody":"When a student first signs up on Scratch, we ask for basic demographic data including gender, age (birth month and year), country, and an email address for verification. This data is used (in aggregated form) in research studies intended to improve our understanding of how people learn with Scratch. When an educator uses a Scratch Teacher Account to create student accounts in bulk, students are not required to provide an email address for account setup.","faq.lawComplianceTitle":"Is Scratch (online version) compliant with United States local and federal data privacy laws?","faq.lawComplianceBody1":"Scratch cares deeply about the privacy of students and of all individuals who use our platform.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Bolehkah lebih dari satu orang menggunakan satu akun?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Bisakan saya mengubah username saya?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Informasi apa yang boleh saya bagikan menggunakan akun saya?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Was ist ein Remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"Wenn ein Scratcher ein Projekt eines anderen kopiert und es modifiziert, indem er oder sie eigene Ideen einbringt (z.B. Skripte oder Kostüme verändert), wird das Ergebnis \"Remix\" genannt. Jedes Projekt, das auf der Scratch-Website veröffentlicht wird, kann so bearbeitet werden. Wir betrachten auch eine kleinere Veränderung als einen gültigen Remix, solange dem ursprünglichen Projekt-Ersteller und anderen, die einen signifikanten Beitrag zu dem Remix geleistet haben, Anerkennung gezollt wird.","faq.remixableTitle":"Warum verlangt das Scratch-Team, dass alle Projekte \"remixbar\" sind?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Was ist, wenn ich nicht will, dass andere meine Projekte remixen?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Kann ich Bilder / Klänge / Medien aus dem Internet in meinen Projekten benutzen?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Wie kann ich überprüfen ob mein Konto bestätigt wurde?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Wie bestätige ich mein Benutzerkonto?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios.

If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Kann ich mehr als einen Account besitzen?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Ist es in Ordnung, wenn sich mehr als eine Person an einem einzigen Benutzerkonto anmeldet?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kann ich meinen Benutzernamen ändern?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Welche Informationen kann ich auf / mit meinem Account veröffentlichen?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Wie lösche ich meinen Account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

Auf gemeine Kommentare mit weiteren gemeinen Kommentaren zu antworten macht die Dinge nur schlechter und kann dazu führen, dass dein Benutzerkonto gesperrt wird. Melde stattdessen einfach alles, was respektlos und nicht konstruktiv erscheint, und wir klären das mit dem Autor. Wir prüfen die Meldungen täglich - sei also versichert, wir kümmern uns darum.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Was unternimmt das Scratch-Team, wenn etwas gemeldet oder gekennzeichnet wird?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Was passiert, wenn ein Benutzerkonto gesperrt wurde?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch in der Schule","faq.howTitle":"Wie wird Scratch in Schulen genutzt?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det OK at mere end en person er logget ind på en konto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account.

If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Hvad sker der, når en konto er blevet blokeret?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

The Scratch 3.0 editor has already been translated into 40+ languages. You can view all the languages currently being translated and reviewed on our {transifexLink}. If you want to help with translation or review, please contact {emailLink}.","faq.transifexLinkText":"translation server","faq.removedBlocksScratch3Title":"Does Scratch 3.0 remove any coding blocks from earlier versions of Scratch?","faq.removedBlocksScratch3Body":"No coding blocks have been removed in Scratch 3.0, but some have changed a bit and others have moved into \"Extensions\" (as described below, in the {extensionsFAQLink} section).","faq.newBlocksScratch3Title":"Does Scratch 3.0 introduce new blocks?","faq.newBlocksScratch3Body":"Yes! In Scratch 3.0 you’ll find:","faq.newBlocksSoundEffect":"New \"sound effect\" blocks","faq.newBlocksOperators":"New operators that make it easier to work with text (strings)","faq.newBlocksPen":"New pen blocks, including support for transparency","faq.newBlocksGlide":"New glide block to move easily to a sprite (or random point)","faq.newBlocksExtensions":"Many new capabilities through \"Scratch Extensions\" (see the Extensions section below)","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Title":"Why are the blocks bigger in Scratch 3.0 than in earlier versions?","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions. Extensions can be added by clicking the button on the bottom left of the screen (see the \"Extensions\" section below).","faq.paintEditorScratch3Title":"What are the new features in the Paint Editor?","faq.paintEditorScratch3Body":"The Paint Editor has been redesigned to provide powerful new features while also making it easier to use.

It offers a number of new features:","faq.soundEditorRecording":"New recording system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorTrimming":"New audio trimming system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorEffects":"New sound effects (such as \"faster\", \"slower\", \"echo\", and \"robot\")","faq.tipsWindwScratch3Title":"What happened to the Scratch Tips Window?","faq.tipsWindowScratch3Body":"Instead of the Tips Window, Scratch 3.0 provides similar material through the Tutorials Library, which can be accessed through the Tutorials link in the top navigation bar in the programming editor. You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

Make sure that you mention \"cloud variables\" when you type your reason in the report.","faq.chatRoomTitle":"Can I make chat rooms with cloud variables?","faq.chatRoomBody":"While it is technically possible to create chat rooms with cloud variables, they are not allowed on the Scratch website.","faq.changeCloudVarTitle":"Who can change the information in a cloud variable?","faq.changeCloudVarBody":"Only you and viewers of your project can store data in your project’s cloud variables. If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch en las Escuelas","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Currently, Scratch Desktop is available for Mac and Windows machines.","faq.communityTitle":"Can I turn off the online community for my students?","faq.communityBody":"The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share, collaborate, and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments. For more information on Scratch Teacher Accounts, see the {eduFaqLink}.","faq.eduFaqLinkText":"Scratch Teacher Account FAQ","faq.requestTitle":"How do I request a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.requestBody":"You may request a Scratch Teacher Account from the {educatorsLink} on Scratch. We ask for additional information during the registration process in order to verify your role as an educator.","faq.dataTitle":"What data does Scratch collect about students?","faq.dataBody":"When a student first signs up on Scratch, we ask for basic demographic data including gender, age (birth month and year), country, and an email address for verification. This data is used (in aggregated form) in research studies intended to improve our understanding of how people learn with Scratch. When an educator uses a Scratch Teacher Account to create student accounts in bulk, students are not required to provide an email address for account setup.","faq.lawComplianceTitle":"Is Scratch (online version) compliant with United States local and federal data privacy laws?","faq.lawComplianceBody1":"Scratch cares deeply about the privacy of students and of all individuals who use our platform.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"איך אני משנה את הסיסמה שלי?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"איך אני יכול לשנות את כתובת הדואר האלקטרוני שלי?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"האם אני יכול להחזיק ביותר מחשבון אחד?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"האם אני יכול לשנות את שם המשתמש שלי?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"כיצד אני יכול למחוק את החשבון שלי?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub. For updated information on development projects relating to the Scratch website, please visit our {developersLink}.","faq.scratch14":"Scratch 1.4","faq.okayToShareTitle":"How do I know what is or isn’t okay to share on the Scratch website?","faq.okayToShareBody":"Check out the Scratch {cgLink} - they’re brief and don’t include a lot of legal stuff. There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"סקראץ' בבתי ספר","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Currently, Scratch Desktop is available for Mac and Windows machines.","faq.communityTitle":"Can I turn off the online community for my students?","faq.communityBody":"The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share, collaborate, and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments.

Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"É correcto que máis dunha persoa use unha conta ao mesmo tempo?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Podo cambiar o meu nome de usuario?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Que información podo compartir na miña conta?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Como borro a miña conta?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab.

But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"iScratch Ezikoleni","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments.

(However, you can’t download projects made with or edited in later versions of Scratch and open them in earlier versions. For example, you can’t open a Scratch 3.0 project in the desktop version of {scratch2Link}, because Scratch 2.0 doesn’t know how to read the .sb3 project file format.)","faq.scratch2":"Scratch 2.0","faq.scratchCostTitle":"How much does Scratch cost? Do I need a license?","faq.scratchCostBody":"Scratch is and always will be free. You don’t need a license to use Scratch in your school, home, or anywhere else.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch u školama","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community.

You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes!

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

Changes and new features include:","faq.paintEditorLayout":"New layout that makes available tools and options more visible","faq.paintEditorTools":"New tools such as an \"eraser\" that works in vector mode","faq.paintEditorColors":"More options for selecting and adjusting colors","faq.paintEditorVector":"More control over vector points (curve handles and point modes)","faq.paintEditorLayers":"Additional controls for ordering layers (\"bring to front\", \"move to back\", etc.)","faq.paintEditorGradients":"New gradient controls","faq.soundEditorScratch3Title":"What are the new features in the Sound Editor?","faq.soundEditorScratch3Body":"The Sound Editor has been redesigned to make it easier to record and manipulate sounds. It offers a number of new features:","faq.soundEditorRecording":"New recording system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorTrimming":"New audio trimming system that is easier to use","faq.soundEditorEffects":"New sound effects (such as \"faster\", \"slower\", \"echo\", and \"robot\")","faq.tipsWindwScratch3Title":"What happened to the Scratch Tips Window?","faq.tipsWindowScratch3Body":"Instead of the Tips Window, Scratch 3.0 provides similar material through the Tutorials Library, which can be accessed through the Tutorials link in the top navigation bar in the programming editor. You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

Make sure that you mention \"cloud variables\" when you type your reason in the report.","faq.chatRoomTitle":"Can I make chat rooms with cloud variables?","faq.chatRoomBody":"While it is technically possible to create chat rooms with cloud variables, they are not allowed on the Scratch website.","faq.changeCloudVarTitle":"Who can change the information in a cloud variable?","faq.changeCloudVarBody":"Only you and viewers of your project can store data in your project’s cloud variables. If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"سکڕاچ لە خوێندنگاکان","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Currently, Scratch Desktop is available for Mac and Windows machines.","faq.communityTitle":"Can I turn off the online community for my students?","faq.communityBody":"The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share, collaborate, and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments. For more information on Scratch Teacher Accounts, see the {eduFaqLink}.","faq.eduFaqLinkText":"Scratch Teacher Account FAQ","faq.requestTitle":"How do I request a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.requestBody":"You may request a Scratch Teacher Account from the {educatorsLink} on Scratch. We ask for additional information during the registration process in order to verify your role as an educator.","faq.dataTitle":"What data does Scratch collect about students?","faq.dataBody":"When a student first signs up on Scratch, we ask for basic demographic data including gender, age (birth month and year), country, and an email address for verification. This data is used (in aggregated form) in research studies intended to improve our understanding of how people learn with Scratch. When an educator uses a Scratch Teacher Account to create student accounts in bulk, students are not required to provide an email address for account setup.","faq.lawComplianceTitle":"Is Scratch (online version) compliant with United States local and federal data privacy laws?","faq.lawComplianceBody1":"Scratch cares deeply about the privacy of students and of all individuals who use our platform.

You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Miért kell minden projekt remixelhető legyen?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Lehetnek-e egyszerre többen bejelentkezve ugyabba a fiókba?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Miként változtathatom meg a felhasználónevem?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Milyen információkat oszthatok meg a fiókomon?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det OK at flere logger seg inn på en brukerkonto samtidig?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan jeg bytte til et annet brukernavn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Hva slags informasjon kan jeg legge ut på brukerkontoen min?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hvordan sletter jeg brukerkontoen min?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Me reknar det som ein remiks sjølv om forandringa er lita, men pass alltid på å oppgje kven dei andre bidragsytarane er.","faq.remixableTitle":"Korfor krev folka bak Scratch at alle prosjekt må kunna remiksast?","faq.remixableBody":"Me meiner det å remiksa andre sine prosjekt er ein veldig god måte å læra å programmera på, og at dette skapar interessante prosjekt. Når ein remiksar, kan dei gode, kreative idéane spreia seg gjennom Scratch-fellesskapet, til glede og nytte for alle. Alle prosjekta ein legg ut på Scratch-nettstaden er under ein «Creative Commons Share Alike»-lisens. Du kan derfor remiksa alle prosjekta du finn her, og andre kan remiksa alle prosjekta dine som du legg ut her.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Kva kan eg gjera viss eg ikkje vil at andre skal kunna remiksa prosjekta mine?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remiksing er ein viktig del av Scratch-fellesskapet.

Brot på desse kan medføra at alle kontoane vert sperra eller sletta.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det greitt at fleire loggar seg inn på same brukarkonto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"Dette er ikkje lov, då nettstaden og programmeringssida lett vert forvirra når fleire er innlogga på same konto. Og når ein konto gjer noko i strid med {cgLink}, vert alle tilhøyrande kontoar sperra eller sletta. Viss du deler konto med nokon som gjer noko gale, kan kontoen verta sperra på grunn av det han eller ho gjorde.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan eg byta til eit anna brukarnamn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"Scratch-nettstaden er avhengig av å ha same namn på brukarkontoane over tid, så det er ikkje mogleg å endra brukarnamnet.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original.

But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Ce este o amestecare?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"De ce impune echipa Scratch ca toate proiectele sa poata fi amestecate?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Si daca nu doresc ca altii sa imi amestece proiectele?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Pot folosi in proiectele mele imagini / sunete / media de pe internet?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Cum pot să verific dacă am contul confirmat?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Cum procedez ca sa imi sterg contul?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Trebuie să îmi confirm contul?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"Cum sa imi schimb parola?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Pot avea mai mult de un cont?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Este voie ca intr-un cont sa se logheze mai mult de o persoana?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Pot sa imi schimb numele de utilizator?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Ce fel de informatii pot sa partajez pe / in legatura cu contul meu?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Cum procedez ca sa imi sterg contul?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money).

It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Pot sa vand proiectele mele Scratch?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Ce sa fac in cazul in care cineva este meschin sau lipsit de respect?","faq.noFlameBody":"Nu te infierbanta! Raspunzand la meschinarii cu comentarii si mai meschine nu faci decat sa fie mai rau si se poate sfarsi cu blocarea contului tau. In schimb, poti sa raportezi orice este lipsit de respect sau neconstructiv, iar noi il vom urmari pe autor. Verificam raportarile zilnic, de mai multe ori pe zi - asa ca stai linistit, vom regla noi lucrurile.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Ce face echipa Scratch cand ceva este raportat sau marcat?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Ce se intampla cand un cont este blocat?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go?

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Je v poriadku, ak jeden účet využíva viacero osôb?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Môžem zmeniť svoje užívateľské meno?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Aké informácie môžem zdieľať na svojom účte?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Är det ok att ha mer än en person inloggad på ett konto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan jag ändra mitt användarnamn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Vilken information kan jag dela på/med mitt konto?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hur raderar jag mitt konto?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Што такое пашырэнні?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch у школах","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

Nosotros verificamos la denuncias todos los días, varias veces al día - así que puedes descasar tranquilo porque nosotros resolveremos las cosas.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"¿Qué hace el equipo de Scratch cuando algo es denunciado o señalado por los usuarios?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"¿Qué pasa cuando una cuenta es bloqueada?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Alguien ha accedido a mi cuenta y la tiene bloqueada. ¿Qué puedo hacer?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"¿Qué son las extensiones?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"En el editor Scratch puedes añadir bloques extra llamados \"extensiones\". Por ejemplo, hay extensiones que permiten programar dispositivos físicos (como micro:bit y kits de robótica de LEGO) y otras para traducir texto dentro de tu proyecto Scratch.

Puedes añadir múltiples extensiones al mismo proyecto.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Cómo puedo crear mi propia extensión para Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"El Scratch Team publicará especificaciones y guías sobre extensiones en el futuro. Una vez estén disponibles podrás enviar tus extensiones al Scratch Team para que se considere tu inclusión en la librería oficial de extensiones de Scratch 3.0. También proporcionaremos guías para desarrollar y distribuir extensiones \"experimentales\", que pueden ser usadas para crear proyectos en ordenadores individuales pero no para compartirlos en la comunidad online de Scratch.","faq.scratchXTitle":"¿Qué ocurrirá con la página web de ScratchX?","faq.scratchXBody":"La página web ScratchX (scratchx.org) fue un laboratorio experimental sobre extensiones. Las extensiones creadas para ScratchX no son compatibles con Scratch 3.0. Una vez que las extensiones experimentales tengan soporte en Scratch, eliminaremos su soporte de ScratchX y proporcionaremos a los desarrolladores y usuarios el tiempo para abandonar ScratchX e ir a la nueva plataforma de extensiones.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"¿Qué son las variables en la nube?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Las variables en la nube permiten que los datos de un proyecto puedan ser guardados y compartidos con otras personas de la comunidad Scratch.

(Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"An bhfuil cead agam níos mó ná cuntas amháin a chruthú?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time.

Als de situatie ingewikkeld is, dan kun je de {contactLink} link (helemaal onderaan op elke pagina) om het uit te leggen. Zorg ervoor dat je zoveel mogelijk informatie geeft, inclusief links naar relevante pagina's.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Wat moet ik doen als ik zie dat iemand gemeen of respectloos is?","faq.noFlameBody":"Gooi geen olie op het vuur! Door op gemene reacties te reageren met meer gemene reacties, maak je het alleen maar erger en dat kan er voor zorgen dat jóuw account geblokkeerd wordt. In plaats daarvan kun je het beste alles, wat respectloos of niet constructief is, melden en dan nemen wij contact op met de schrijver. We controleren de meldingen elke dag, meerdere keren per dag - wees er dus gerust op dat wij het voor je regelen.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Wat doet het Scratch-team als er iets gemeld of gerapporteerd wordt?","faq.reviewContentBody":"Het Scratch-team bekijkt gemelde opmerkingen, reacties en projecten elke dag. Als iets niet in overeenstemming is met de{cgLink} zullen we het verwijderen en een waarschuwing sturen naar het account. We kunnen ook de accounts of netwerken blokkeren die gebruikt werden om het te delen, afhankelijk van wat er gedeeld werd en of de persoon al eerder een waarschuwing heeft gekregen.","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Wat gebeurd er met een gebruikersnaam dat geblokkeerd is?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"Wanneer een account geblokkeerd is, kan de eigenaar geen toegang meer krijgen tot zijn of haar account, deze niet meer gebruiken om projecten aan te maken of nieuwe opmerkingen te plaatsen. Wanneer ingelogd wordt komt een pagina die uitlegt waarom het account geblokkeerd is, samen met een webformulier dat gebruikt kan worden om te vragen om de blokkering op te heffen. Als de eigenaar kan laten zien dat hij of zij begrijpt waarom het account geblokkeerd is, en belooft om de Scratch {cgLink} in de toekomst op te volgen, wordt de blokkade opgeheven.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Iemand kreeg toegang tot mijn account en nu is mijn account geblokkeerd. Wat moet ik doen?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"Jij bent verantwoordelijk voor het beveiligen van je wachtwoord. Als iemand die je kent de controle over je account heeft genomen en slechte dingen heeft gedaan, vertel het dan aan de volwassenen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de computer die daarvoor gebruikt is. Als je denkt dat iemand die je niet kent toegang heeft tot je account, verander dan het wachtwoord en/of gebruik de{contactLink}link om de situatie uit te leggen. Als je account geblokkeerd is wegens iets dat jij hebt gedaan wat volgens de Scratch {cgLink}niet mag, vertel ons dan alsjeblieft niet dat iemand anders het heeft gedaan. Als mensen ons vertellen dat iemand anders hun account heeft gebruikt om iets verkeerds te doen, dan moeten we proberen met die persoon te praten voordat we het account kunnen herstellen. Dit betekent dat je account langer geblokkeerd blijft dan wanneer je eerlijk tegen ons bent over wat er gebeurd is.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Wat zijn uitbreidingen?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In de Scratch-editor kun je verzamelingen van extra blokken toevoegen die \" uitbreidingen\" worden genoemd. Er zijn bijvoorbeeld uitbreidingen waarmee je fysieke apparaten kunt programmeren (zoals micro:bit en LEGO robotica sets) en tekst kunt vertalen binnen je Scratch projecten. We zullen na verloop van tijd nieuwe uitbreidingen blijven toevoegen, zodat wat je met Scratch kunt doen in de loop van de tijd zal blijven groeien. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"Hoe voeg ik een uitbreiding toe aan een project? ","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"Als je klikt op de \"Voeg een uitbreiding toe\" knop in de linkerbenedenhoek van de Scratch programmeereditor, zie je een lijst van alle Scratch uitbreidingen. Wanneer je een van de uitbreidingen selecteert, wordt er een nieuwe categorie van blokken aan je project toegevoegd. De uitbreiding wordt automatisch geladen elke keer wanneer je project wordt geopend. Je kunt meer extensies aan hetzelfde project toevoegen.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Hoe maak ik mijn eigen uitbreiding voor Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"Het Scratch Team zal in de toekomst specificaties en richtlijnen voor uitbreidingen publiceren. Eenmaal beschikbaar, kun je uitbreidingen indienen bij het Scratch team voor bestudering in de officiële Scratch 3.0 uitbreidingen bibliotheek. We bieden ook richtlijnen voor het ontwikkelen en distribueren van \"experimentele\" uitbreidingen, die gebruikt kunnen worden om projecten te maken op individuele computers, maar niet gedeeld worden in de Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"Wat gebeurt er met de ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"De ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was een experimentele testomgeving voor uitbreidingen. Uitbreidingen die voor ScratchX zijn gemaakt, zijn niet te combineren met Scratch 3.0. Zodra experimentele uitbreidingen volledig worden ondersteund in Scratch zullen we de ondersteuning voor ScratchX stopzetten en ontwikkelaars en gebruikers tijd geven om over te stappen van ScratchX naar het nieuwe uitbreidingen platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"Wat zijn cloud variabelen?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variabelen maken het mogelijk om gegevens van een project op te slaan en te delen met andere mensen in de Scratch-community. Met behulp van cloud variabelen kun je vragenlijsten en andere projecten maken waar anderen in de community de gegevens in de loop der tijd kunnen raadplegen en wijzigen.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"Hoe kan ik een cloud variabele maken?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Ga naar het \"Variabelen\" deel van het blokken palet, selecteer \"Maak een variabele\" en klik vervolgens op het selectievakje bij \"Cloud variabele (opgeslagen op server)\".

Zorg ervoor dat je \"cloud variabelen\" vermeldt wanneer je je reden in het rapport typt.","faq.chatRoomTitle":"Kan ik chatrooms maken met cloud variabelen?","faq.chatRoomBody":"Hoewel het technisch mogelijk is om chatrooms te maken met cloud variabelen, zijn deze niet toegestaan op de Scratch website.","faq.changeCloudVarTitle":"Wie kan de informatie in een cloudvariabele veranderen?","faq.changeCloudVarBody":"Alleen jij en de bezoekers van je project kunnen gegevens opslaan in de cloud variabelen van je project. Als mensen klikken op \"Bekijk van binnen\" of je code remixen, wordt er een kopie van de variabele gemaakt en de oorspronkelijke variabele wordt niet beïnvloed of gewijzigd.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"Ik ben ingelogd, maar ik kan nog geen projecten gebruiken met cloud variabelen. Hoe kan dit?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"Als je nog steeds een \"Nieuwe Scratcher\" bent op de website, zul je geen projecten met cloud variabelen kunnen gebruiken. Je moet een \"Scratcher\" worden om toegang te hebben tot cloud variabelen. Zie het gedeelte Accounts (hierboven) voor meer informatie over de overgang van \"Nieuwe Scratcher\" naar \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is het mogelijk om multiplayer games te maken met cloud variabelen?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games kunnen moeilijk te maken zijn, vanwege netwerksnelheid en synchronisatieproblemen. Desondanks bedenken sommige Scratchers creatieve manieren om de cloud variabelen te gebruiken voor om-de-beurt en andere soorten spelletjes.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch in Scholen","faq.howTitle":"Hoe wordt Scratch in scholen gebruikt?","faq.howBody":"Scratch wordt gebruikt in honderdduizenden scholen over de hele wereld, op tal van verschillende vakgebieden (waaronder taalkunst, wetenschap, geschiedenis, wiskunde en informatica).

We begrijpen echter dat sommige leerkrachten er de voorkeur aan geven dat hun studenten niet deelnemen aan een online community. Deze leerkrachten kunnen de Scratch Desktop installeren, die offline en lokaal op een desktop of laptop computer draait.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"Wat is een Scratch leerkracht account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"Een Scratch leerkrachtaccount voorziet leerkrachten van extra opties om studentenparticipatie te beheren op Scratch, inclusief de mogelijkheid om studentenaccounts te maken, studentenprojecten in studios te organiseren, en commentaar van studenten te monitoren.

Dzięki remiksowaniu kreatywne pomysły rozprzestrzeniają się w społeczności Scratch i wszyscy odnoszą korzyści. Wszystkie projekty udostępnione w witrynie Scratch są objęte licencją “Creative Commons Share Alike“, co oznacza, że możesz zremiksować każdy projekt widoczny na stronie Scratch - a wszyscy inni mogą remiksować dowolne projekty udostępnione w witrynie .","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"A co, jeśli nie chcę, aby inni remiksowali moje projekty?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remiksowanie jest ważną częścią społeczności Scratch.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Czy jest w porządku, aby więcej niż jedna osoba logowała się na konto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Czy mogę zmienić nazwę mojego konta?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"Struktura witryny Scratch zależy od posiadania spójnej nazwy konta, więc nie można zmienić nazwy użytkownika.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Ktoś uzyskał dostęp do mojego konta i zablokował moje konto.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Czym są rozszerzenia?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"W edytorze Scratch możesz dodawać kolekcje dodatkowych bloków o nazwie \"rozszerzenia\". Na przykład istnieją rozszerzenia, które umożliwiają programowanie fizycznych urządzeń (takich jak zestawy narzędzi mikro-bitowych i LEGO) oraz tłumaczenie tekstu w ramach projektów Scratch.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked.

If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

In Scratch 3.0 you’ll find:","faq.newBlocksSoundEffect":"New \"sound effect\" blocks","faq.newBlocksOperators":"New operators that make it easier to work with text (strings)","faq.newBlocksPen":"New pen blocks, including support for transparency","faq.newBlocksGlide":"New glide block to move easily to a sprite (or random point)","faq.newBlocksExtensions":"Many new capabilities through \"Scratch Extensions\" (see the Extensions section below)","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Title":"Why are the blocks bigger in Scratch 3.0 than in earlier versions?","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Шта је прерада?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Зашто Скрач тим тражи да сви пројекти буду \"преуредљиви\"?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Шта уколико ја не желим да други могу да преуређују моје пројекте?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community.

To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Како могу да проверим да ли је мој налог потврђен?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Како потврђујем свој налог?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Могу ли да имам више од једног налога?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Да ли је уреду да више особа буде пријављено на исти налог?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Могу ли да променим своје име за пријаву?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Које информације могу да делим са / путем мог налога?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Како да обришем мој налог?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Шта да урадим уколико приметим да је неко злонамеран или непристојан?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Шта се дешава када је један налог блокиран?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Скрач у школи","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

In Scratch 3.0 you’ll find:","faq.newBlocksSoundEffect":"New \"sound effect\" blocks","faq.newBlocksOperators":"New operators that make it easier to work with text (strings)","faq.newBlocksPen":"New pen blocks, including support for transparency","faq.newBlocksGlide":"New glide block to move easily to a sprite (or random point)","faq.newBlocksExtensions":"Many new capabilities through \"Scratch Extensions\" (see the Extensions section below)","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Title":"Why are the blocks bigger in Scratch 3.0 than in earlier versions?","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Bản phối lại là gì?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"Khi Scratcher tạo bản sao của những chương trình khác và thay đổi để thêm ý tưởng cá nhân (ví dụ, bằng việc thay đổi kịch bản hoặc hóa trang), sự thay đổi đó được gọi là \"phối lại\".  Mỗi chương trình được chia sẻ trên website Scratch có thể phối lại được. Chúng tôi cho rằng thậm chí một thay đổi nhỏ có thể xem như một bản phối lại hợp lệ, miễn là ghi nguồn cho người tạo dự án ban đầu và những người khác có đóng góp đáng kể cho bản phối lại đó.","faq.remixableTitle":"Tại sao Scratch Team yêu cầu tất cả dự án đều “có thể phối lại”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra nếu tôi không muốn những người khác phối lại dự án của tôi?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Tôi có thể sử dụng những hình ảnh, âm thanh, phương thức truyền thông từ mạng Internet trong chương trình của tôi được không?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Làm sao tôi có thể kiểm tra tài khoản của tôi đã được xác nhận hay chưa?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Làm sao tôi xác nhận tài khoản của mình?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Tôi có phải xác nhận tài khoản của mình không? ","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"Làm sao tôi có thể thay đổi mật khẩu?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"Làm sao tôi có thể thay đổi địa chỉ email?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"Làm sao tôi có thể chuyển từ 'New Scratcher' sang 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Tôi có thể có nhiều hơn một tài khoản được không?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Liệu có thể nhiều người cùng đăng nhập vào một tài khoản được không?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Tôi có thể thay đổi tên người dùng được không?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Tôi có thể chia sẻ thông tin gì trên / bằng tài khoản của tôi?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Làm thế nào để xóa tài khoản?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes!

Đáp lại những bình luận tồi bằng những bình luận tồi hơn sẽ làm tình hình xấu đi, và có thể khiến tài khoản của bạn bị khóa. Thay vào đó, bạn chỉ cần Báo cáo bất kì điều gì có nội dung không tôn trọng và không mang tính đóng góp, và chúng tôi sẽ theo dõi tác giả đó. Chúng tôi sẽ kiểm tra phần báo cáo mỗi ngày, nhiều lần trong một ngày - Vì vậy hãy yên tâm nhé, chúng tôi sẽ xử lý ổn thoả thôi.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Scratch team sẽ làm gì khi nhận được báo cáo hoặc nghi ngờ?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Chuyện gì sẽ xảy ra khi tài khoản cá nhân bị khóa?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked.

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Вместо това, просто докладвайте всичко, което сметнете за грубо и неуместно, а ние ще се свържем с автора. Ние проверяваме докладите всеки ден, и то много пъти – така че не се притеснявайте, ще оправим нещата.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Какво прави екипът на Scratch, когато нещо бъде докладвано или отбелязано?","faq.reviewContentBody":"Екипът на Scratch преглежда докладваните коментари и проекти всеки ден. Ако нещо е в разрез с Обществените правила на Scratch {cgLink}, ние може да го премахнем и да изпратим предупреждение на акаунта. В зависимост от нарушението или ако вече сме предупреждавали този акаунт, може да блокираме акаунтите или мрежите, които са били използвани.","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Какво става, когато акаунт бъде блокиран?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"Когато един акаунт е блокиран, собственикът му вече няма да има достъп до него и няма да може да създава проекти или да пише коментари. Когато влязат, те виждат страница, която обяснява защо профилът е блокиран, както и уеб формуляр, който могат да използват, за да поискат да бъдат деблокирани. Ако собственикът може да покаже, че разбира защо акаунтът му е бил блокиран и обещае да спазва обществените правила {cgLink} в бъдеще, то екипът на Scratch ще разгледа случая. ","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Някой е получил достъп до профила ми и профилът ми е блокиран. Какво да правя?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"Вие носите отговорност за защитата на вашата парола. Ако някой, когото познавате, е използвал профила ви и е правил лоши неща, кажете на възрастните, които отговарят за този компютър. Ако смятате, че някой, който не познавате, има достъп до профила ви, променете паролата и / или използвайте връзката{contactLink}, за да обясните ситуацията. Ако профилът Ви бе блокиран за извършване на нещо, което сте направили и това е нарушило Scratch{cgLink}, моля, не ни казвайте, че някой друг го е направил. Когато хората ни кажат, че някой друг е използвал профила им, за да направи нещо лошо, тогава трябва да се опитаме да говорим с него, преди да можем да възстановим профила. Това означава, че профилът ви ще остане блокиран много по-дълго, отколкото ако сте честни с нас за случилото се.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Какво представляват добавките?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"В редактора Scratch можете да добавяте колекции от допълнителни блокове, наречени „разширения“. Например, съществуват разширения, които ви позволяват да програмирате физически устройства (като micro:bit и комплекти за роботика LEGO) и да превеждате текст в рамките на вашите проекти Scratch.

Можете да добавите няколко разширения към един и същ проект.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Как да създам собствено разширение за Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"Екипът на Scratch ще публикува спецификации и указания за разширения в бъдеще. Веднъж достъпни, ще можете да изпращате разширения на екипа на Scratch за разглеждане в официалната библиотека с добавки за Scratch 3.0. Също така ще предоставим указания за разработване и разпространение на „експериментални“ разширения, които могат да се използват за създаване на проекти на отделни компютри, но не се споделят в онлайн общността на Scratch.","faq.scratchXTitle":"Какво ще се случи със сайта на ScratchX?","faq.scratchXBody":"Уебсайтът на ScratchX (scratchx.org) беше експериментален тест за разширения. Разширенията, създадени за ScratchX, не са съвместими с Scratch 3.0. След като експерименталните разширения се поддържат изцяло в Scratch, ще преустановим поддръжката на ScratchX и ще предоставим на разработчиците и потребителите време да преминат от ScratchX към новата платформа за разширения.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"Какво представляват облачните променливи?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Облачните променливи позволяват да се съхраняват данни от проекта и да се споделят с други хора в общността Scratch.

Ако хората „виждат вътре” или ремиксират кода, той създава копие на променливата и не засяга или променя първоначалната променлива.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"Влязох, но не мога да използвам проекти с променливи в облака Какво се случва?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"Ако все още сте \"New Scratcher\" на уебсайта, няма да можете да използвате проекти с облачни променливи. Трябва да станете „Scratcher“, за да имате достъп до облачните променливи. Вижте раздела „Акаунти“ (по-горе) за повече информация относно прехода от „New Scratcher“ към „Scratcher“.","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Възможно ли е да се правят мултиплеър игри с облачни променливи?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Мрежовите игри може да са трудни за създаване, поради скоростта на мрежата и проблеми със синхронизацията. Въпреки това някои потребители успяват да ползват облачните данни по много изобретателни начини, за да създават походови  и други видове игри.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch в училищата","faq.howTitle":"Как се използва Scratch в училищата?","faq.howBody":"Scratch се използва в стотици хиляди училища по целия свят, в много различни тематични области (включително езикови изкуства, наука, история, математика и компютърни науки).
