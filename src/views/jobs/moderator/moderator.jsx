                Scratch is a free service where young people learn to
                program by creating interactive stories, games, and
                animations which they can share to an online community.
                Scratch has grown to more than 30 million registered
                members (ages 8 and up) who create and share thousands
                of projects each day. Moderators will gain valuable
                experience working online with youth in a creative,
                interest-driven setting.
